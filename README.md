Responsiveness Assignment
This is my first assignment using Bootstrap to create a responsive portfolio using only html and css. I have contributed to this project continuously, as I have completed each
homework assignment.
As I learn more with each new exercise, I have become more proud of the work I am doing,
and the progress these apps demonstrate.
I am planning on introducing javaScript to this portfolio soon, but for now it looks 
respectable. I just added a link to my Linkedin page, and I included an animated icon using only the aforementioned html and css.
Please check back occasionally to judge for yourself how I am doing.
Thank You!
